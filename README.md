Alpha Animals Combat Extended Patch for CE/RimWorld 1.1

## Disclaimer ##
I do not own nor have any intellectual property rights over Alpha Animals nor Combat Extended. This is a voluntary project made for the purpose of making these both mods be compatible with each other.

The Patch might have some balance issues, in which case I **kindly** beg of you to do the adequate PR request or just send me a message with the proposed changes.

The current values are not contained in a different readme since this is my FIRST patch attempt, and I'm quite new to the CE Patch (only 2 weeks in).

I'm also unfamiliar with the github environment, so please bear with me.

I'm also NOT planning to post this in Steam, since I want this to be my humble contribution to the CE-included patches, with no self-interest involved. Also, if Alpha Animals or CE make complicated changes to their XML structure, I do not compromise myself with making updates.

Feel free to do some spreadsheeting in CE's standards and send them to me. I swear I'll give due credit to anyone that contributes to this.
